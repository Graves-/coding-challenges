/*
    Array Change

    You are given an array of integers. 
    On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of 
    its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required 
    to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

    Example

        For inputArray = [1, 1, 1], the output should be
        arrayChange(inputArray) = 3.

        [-1000, 0, -2, 0]
        5

        [2, 1, 10, 1]
        12

        8,5

        [2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 4, 12, 12, 10, 15]
        13
